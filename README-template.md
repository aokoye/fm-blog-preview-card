## My process

### Built with
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I used a media query for the first time. Not difficult but very useful

### Continued development
I want to get better at responsive design. I know it will happen if I continue on the path I'm currently on (The Odin Project and supplementing with Frontend Mentor and the 50 Projects in 50 Days course), but it's good to know where my weaknesses are.
